## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

The design includes different images for mobile and desktop, requiring a responsive image solution.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Bootstrap 5
- CSS custom properties (design tokens)
- Flexbox & Bootstrap Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive images using the `<picture>` element

---

### What I learned

In this project, I reinforced several core frontend concepts:

- How to structure a component using **semantic HTML** (`main`, `article`, `section`, `picture`).
- How to combine **Bootstrap utilities** with **custom CSS** to keep styles minimal and maintainable.
- How to implement **responsive images** correctly using the `<picture>` element instead of CSS hacks.
- How to follow a scalable **naming convention** inspired by BEM for custom styles.
- How to match a design system precisely using CSS variables from a style guide.

This approach allowed me to reduce custom CSS while still achieving a pixel-accurate result.

---

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Improve accessibility further (ARIA roles and contrast testing).
- Explore more complex responsive image strategies (`srcset` with multiple resolutions).
- Refactor similar components into reusable UI patterns.
- Continue balancing utility-first frameworks with clean custom CSS.

---

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/)  
  Helped structure the layout efficiently with minimal custom CSS.

- [MDN Web Docs – Responsive Images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images)  
  Essential for understanding the correct use of the `<picture>` element.

- [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)  
  Great platform to practice real-world frontend challenges.
